                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 cups graunulated sugar</li>
                        <li>3/4 cups Duych-processed coco poweder</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Instrcutions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat 
                            to 350 degrees <sup>F</sup>. Grease a Bundt pan 
                            butter or vegetable shortening and dust with cocoa 
                            powder or all-purpose flour, tapping any excess out 
                            of the pan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, cocoa powder, 
                            flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and ground 
                            ginger. Set aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, yolk, cooled 
                            coffee, buttermilk, vanilla and oil. Careful to not 
                            slosh the mixture onto the countertop. I’ve done 
                            this more times than I care to admit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and use a 
                            rubber spatula to fold the two together. The batter 
                            will be fairly loose but whisk until no lumps 
                            remain. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, 
                            scraping the bowl to get every last bit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bake for 45-55 minutes or until a cake tester 
                            inserted in the cake comes out dry or with just a 
                            few moist crumbs, not wet batter. Remove from the 
                            oven and allow the cake to cool for 15-20 minutes 
                            before trying to remove the cake from the pan. As 
                            the cake cooled, the edges should have pulled away 
                            from the sides of the pan a bit. You may want to 
                            carefully poke a butter knife along the sides of the 
                            pan to ease the cake away from the pan before 
                            inverting the cake onto a wire rack.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Serve warm or at room temperature dusted with 
                            powdered sugar and a side of softly whipped cream. 
                            Store cake, wrapped or in a lidded cake stand at 
                            room temperate. Keep a knife close by (aka on the 
                            cake plate) for slicing.
                        </li>
