                        <b>Elephants</b> are the largest living land animals. 
                        Three living species are currently recognised: the 
                        African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African 
                        forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant 
                        (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members 
                        of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; 
                        extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.
                        Distinctive features of elephants include a long 
                        proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, 
                        pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. 
                        The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the 
                        mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived 
                        from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as 
                        tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear 
                        flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature 
                        as well as in communication. African elephants have 
                        larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants 
                        have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

                        Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, 
                        South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in 
                        different habitats, including savannahs, forests, 
                        deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they 
                        stay near water when it is accessible. They are 
                        considered to be keystone species, due to their impact 
                        on their environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion 
                        society, in which multiple family groups come together 
                        to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family 
                        groups, which can consist of one female with her calves 
                        or several related females with offspring. The leader 
                        of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as 
                        the matriarch.

                        The word elephant is based on the Latin elephas 
                        (genitive elephantis) 'elephant', which is the 
                        Latinised form of the ancient Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) 
                        (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos<sup>[1]</sup>)), probably from a 
                        non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician.<sup>[2]</sup> It is 
                        attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (
                        genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.<sup>[
                        3][4]</sup> As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word 
                        to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also 
                        referred to the animal. The word elephant appears in 
                        Middle English as olyfaunt (c. 1300) and was borrowed 
                        from Old French oliphant (12th century).<sup>[2]</sup>

                        Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole 
                        remaining family within the order Proboscidea. Their 
                        closest extant relatives are the sirenians 
                        (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they 
                        share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder 
                        Afrotheria.<sup>[6]</sup> Elephants and sirenians are further 
                        grouped in the clade Tethytheria.

                        Three species of living elephants are recognised; the 
                        African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), forest 
                        elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and Asian elephant 
                        (Elephas maximus).<sup>[8]</sup> African elephants were 
                        traditionally considered a single species, Loxodonta 
                        africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their 
                        status as separate species.<sup>[9][10][11]</sup>
                        Mammoths (Mammuthus) are nested within living elephants 
                        as they are more closely related to Asian elephants than 
                        to African elephants.<sup>[12]</sup> Another extinct 
                        genus of elephant, Palaeoloxodon, is also recognised, 
                        which appears to have close affinities with African 
                        elephants and to have hybridised with African forest 
                        elephants.

                        A major event in proboscidean evolution was the 
                        collision of Afro-Arabia with Eurasia, during the Early 
                        Miocene, around 18–19 million years ago, allowing 
                        proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland 
                        across Eurasia and later, around 16–15 million years 
                        ago into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. 
                        Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene 
                        include the deinotheres, along with the more advanced 
                        elephantimorphs, including mammutids (mastodons), 
                        gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the 
                        "shovel tuskers" like Platybelodon), choerolophodontids 
                        and stegodontids.<sup>[21]</sup> Around 10 million years 
                        ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae 
                        emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres.

                        Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, 
                        fruit, bark, grass, and roots. African elephants mostly 
                        browse, while Asian elephants mainly graze.[34] They 
                        can eat as much as 300 kg (660 lb) of food and drink 40 
                        L (11 US gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay 
                        near water sources. They have morning, afternoon, and 
                        nighttime feeding sessions. At midday, elephants rest 
                        under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping 
                        occurs at night while the animal is lying down.
                        Elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day. Both 
                        males and family groups typically move no more than 20 
                        km (12 mi) a day, but distances as far as 180 km 
                        (112 mi) have been recorded in the Etosha region of 
                        Namibia. Elephants go on seasonal migrations in response 
                        to changes in environmental conditions. In northern 
                        Botswana, they travel 325 km (202 mi) to the Chobe 
                        River after the local waterholes dry up in late August.

                    <p>
                        Because of their large size, elephants have a huge 
                        impact on their environments and are considered keystone 
                        species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth 
                        can transform savannah into grasslands; smaller 
                        herbivores can access trees mowed down by elephants. 
                        When they dig for water during droughts, they create 
                        waterholes that can be used by other animals. When 
                        they use waterholes, they end up making them bigger. 
                        At Mount Elgon, elephants dig through caves and pave 
                        the way for ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects.
                        Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest 
                        elephants consume and deposit many seeds over great 
                        distances, with either no effect or a positive effect on 
                        germination. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant 
                        herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport 
                        and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled 
                        by the smaller Malayan tapir. Because most of the food 
                        elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide 
                        food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. 
                        Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems. 
                        At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, elephant 
                        numbers have threatened several species of small birds 
                        that depend on woodlands. Their weight causes the soil 
                        to compress, leading to runoff and erosion.

                    <h3><b>Status</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        African bush elephants were listed as Endangered by the 
                        International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
                        in 2021, and African forest elephants were listed as 
                        Critically Endangered in the same year. In 1979, 
                        Africa had an estimated population of at least 1.3 
                        million elephants, possibly as high as 3.0 million. 
                        A decade later, the population was estimated to be 
                        609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in 
                        Eastern Africa, 204,000 in Southern Africa, and 19,000 
                        in Western Africa. The population of rainforest elephants 
                        was lower than anticipated, at around 214,000 
                        individuals. Between 1977 and 1989, elephant populations 
                        declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in 
                        elephant numbers hastened, and savannah populations from 
                        Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. 
                        African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. 
                        Population trends in southern Africa were various, 
                        with unconfirmed losses in Zambia, Mozambique and 
                        Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe 
                        and were stable in South Africa. The IUCN estimated that 
                        total population in Africa is estimated at to 415,000 
                        individuals for both species combined as of 2016.

                    <h3><b>Working animal</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        Elephants have been working animals since at least the 
                        Indus Valley civilization over 4,000 years ago[156] and 
                        continue to be used in modern times. There were 
                        13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 
                        2000. These animals are typically captured from the 
                        wild when they are 10–20 years old when they are both 
                        more trainable and can work for more years.[157] They 
                        were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but 
                        since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.[158] 
                        Individuals of the Asian species have been often 
                        trained as working animals. Asian elephants are used 
                        to carry and pull both objects and people in and out 
                        of areas as well as lead people in religious 
                        celebrations. They are valued over mechanised tools as 
                        they can perform the same tasks but in more difficult 
                        terrain, with strength, memory, and delicacy. Elephants 
                        can learn over 30 commands.

                        Musth bulls are 
                        difficult and dangerous to work with and so are chained 
                        up until their condition passes.[159]
                        In India, many working elephants are alleged to have 
                        been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants 
                        are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to 
                        Animals Act of 1960.[160] In both Myanmar and Thailand, 
                        deforestation and other economic factors have resulted 
                        in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting 
                        in health problems for the elephants themselves as well 
                        as economic and safety problems for the people amongst 
                        whom they live.
