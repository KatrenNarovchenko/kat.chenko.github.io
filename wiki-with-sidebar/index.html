                        <b>Elephants</b> are the largest living land animals. 
                        Three living species are currently recognised: the 
                        African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African 
                        forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant 
                        (Elephas maximus). They are the only surviving members 
                        of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; 
                        extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons.
                        Distinctive features of elephants include a long 
                        proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, 
                        pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. 
                        The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the 
                        mouth and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived 
                        from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as 
                        tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear 
                        flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature 
                        as well as in communication. African elephants have 
                        larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants 
                        have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

                        Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, 
                        South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in 
                        different habitats, including savannahs, forests, 
                        deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they 
                        stay near water when it is accessible. They are 
                        considered to be keystone species, due to their impact 
                        on their environments. Elephants have a fission–fusion 
                        society, in which multiple family groups come together 
                        to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family 
                        groups, which can consist of one female with her calves 
                        or several related females with offspring. The leader 
                        of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as 
                        the matriarch.

                        The word elephant is based on the Latin elephas 
                        (genitive elephantis) 'elephant', which is the 
                        Latinised form of the ancient Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) 
                        (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos<sup>[1]</sup>)), probably from a 
                        non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician.<sup>[2]</sup> It is 
                        attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (
                        genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.<sup>[
                        3][4]</sup> As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word 
                        to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also 
                        referred to the animal. The word elephant appears in 
                        Middle English as olyfaunt (c. 1300) and was borrowed 
                        from Old French oliphant (12th century).<sup>[2]</sup>

                        Elephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole 
                        remaining family within the order Proboscidea. Their 
                        closest extant relatives are the sirenians 
                        (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they 
                        share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder 
                        Afrotheria.<sup>[6]</sup> Elephants and sirenians are further 
                        grouped in the clade Tethytheria.

                        Three species of living elephants are recognised; the 
                        African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), forest 
                        elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and Asian elephant 
                        (Elephas maximus).<sup>[8]</sup> African elephants were 
                        traditionally considered a single species, Loxodonta 
                        africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their 
                        status as separate species.<sup>[9][10][11]</sup>
                        Mammoths (Mammuthus) are nested within living elephants 
                        as they are more closely related to Asian elephants than 
                        to African elephants.<sup>[12]</sup> Another extinct 
                        genus of elephant, Palaeoloxodon, is also recognised, 
                        which appears to have close affinities with African 
                        elephants and to have hybridised with African forest 
                        elephants.

                        A major event in proboscidean evolution was the 
                        collision of Afro-Arabia with Eurasia, during the Early 
                        Miocene, around 18–19 million years ago, allowing 
                        proboscideans to disperse from their African homeland 
                        across Eurasia and later, around 16–15 million years 
                        ago into North America across the Bering Land Bridge. 
                        Proboscidean groups prominent during the Miocene 
                        include the deinotheres, along with the more advanced 
                        elephantimorphs, including mammutids (mastodons), 
                        gomphotheres, amebelodontids (which includes the 
                        "shovel tuskers" like Platybelodon), choerolophodontids 
                        and stegodontids.<sup>[21]</sup> Around 10 million years 
                        ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae 
                        emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres.
